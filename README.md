Hi. This is my repo for everything and nothing. It is used in [several blog posts](https://blog.f12.no) and for workshops.

# The Examples
This is a small collection of code I hope shows some good concepts. Please let me know what you think. ðŸ˜„

This repo is updated continuously, so be sure to star and watch it for updates.

A few notes on things I am trying to show in this code. You can find links to the specific examples on each page (if there are any):
- [Test Driven Development](doc/tdd.md)
  - [Test Fakes](doc/fakes.md)
  - [Test Setup](doc/test-setup.md)
  - [Testing Through The Domain](doc/tttd.md)
- [System Design](doc/system-design.md)
  - [Manual Dependency Injection](doc/manual-dependency-injection.md)
  - [Sum types](doc/sum-types.md)

A lot of this content has come out of endless discussions with fellow developers.
But special thanks goes out to Asgaut MjÃ¸lne, Ola Hast, and Terje Heen for the regular discussions we have.

# The workshop

If you're looking for the workshop, you can [find it here](doc/workshop/README.md).

# Using this code and building

## Prerequisites
Install [asdf-vm.com](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html)

ASDF will make sure you have the right tools and versions. If not:
- Java 21
- Git

## Build and terminal
1. Download this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anderssv/the-example.git
   cd the-example
   ```
2. Install Java using ASDF:
   ```bash
   asdf plugin add java    # Only needed if you haven't installed the Java plugin before
   asdf install           # This will install Java 21 as specified in .tool-versions
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

## Development environment

It works with most editors, but I recommend using IntelliJ IDEA.
Most stuff is good with default plugins, but I also recommend:
- [Mermaid](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20146-mermaid) plugin
- [Markdown](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7793-markdown) plugin
- [Supermaven](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23893-supermaven) plugin
- [GitHub Copilot](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17718-github-copilot) plugin
