This is a start inspired by a talk at JavaZone 2022 about Type Driven Development. It s really a way to try and do sum types in (Java in the talk) Kotlin. https://2022.javazone.no/#/program/54a82962-e8f4-424c-864a-e1f987825dc7

I wanted to see how I could include parser frameworks (Jackson) in this to get a complete pipeline where types are safer and have more information straight away. Still early work, but I do think it can be valuable.

Parse don't validate by Alexis King was mentioned and is a big inspiration: https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/
