# TDD Workshop Summary

Based on the materials provided, the TDD (Test-Driven Development) workshop is a comprehensive 4-hour session designed to help developers improve their testing practices and create more maintainable code. The workshop combines theoretical concepts with hands-on exercises using Kotlin examples.

## Workshop Structure

### Part 1: Introduction to TDD
- **Core Concepts**: Explanation of TDD philosophy, the red-green-refactor cycle, and the benefits of writing tests before code
- **Test Coverage**: Discussion on appropriate levels of test coverage and when TDD is most beneficial
- **Test Types**: Overview of different test levels (unit, integration, system, etc.)
- **Test Data Management**: Introduction to Object Mother pattern and test data builders for reusable test setup
- **Exercise 1**: Practical session on setting up test data and implementing the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

### Part 2: Testing Techniques
- **Test Doubles**: Detailed explanation of fakes, mocks, and stubs with emphasis on fakes for maintainable tests
- **Testing Through the Domain**: Approach for writing domain-oriented tests that are less brittle to implementation changes
- **Test DSLs**: Creating domain-specific languages for more readable and maintainable tests
- **Test Helpers**: Implementation of utility classes to simplify test setup
- **Exercise 2**: Hands-on practice implementing fakes, test helpers, and working with the test clock

### Part 3: Testable Architecture
- **Manual Dependency Injection**: Implementation and benefits over frameworks
- **Simple Architecture**: Designing systems that are inherently testable
- **Observability**: Incorporating logs, metrics, and traces
- **Performance Considerations**: Techniques for faster tests including streaming, profiling
- **Exercise 3**: Implementing manual dependency injection and working with asynchronous code testing

### Conclusion
- Summary of key learnings
- Q&A session
- Guidance on applying these concepts to participants' own codebases

## Key Themes Throughout the Workshop

1. **Maintainability**: Techniques to make tests that break only when they should, not due to unrelated changes
2. **Speed**: Ensuring tests run quickly enough to be part of a tight feedback loop
3. **Reusability**: Patterns for creating test components that can be reused across the test suite
4. **Readability**: Making tests that clearly express their intent and serve as documentation
5. **Practical Implementation**: Real-world examples in Kotlin showing how to implement these patterns

The workshop demonstrates these concepts using a sample application that includes:
- An application service with repositories
- Customer registration functionality
- Test fakes for different components
- Test helpers for clock manipulation and data setup
- Examples of manual dependency injection

The material emphasizes pragmatic approaches to testing that help developers create maintainable test suites that provide value over time rather than becoming a burden during refactoring.
